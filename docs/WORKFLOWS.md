# Workflows Quick Reference

Primary workflow documentation lives in:
- `docs/runbooks/WORKFLOWS.md`

## Quick Actions
- Open workflow catalog: `/workflows`
- Install template from catalog
- Enable/disable installed workflow
- Check execution logs in workflow detail view

## Safety Defaults
- No PII in logs
- Mail actions remain fail-closed without required credentials/keys
- Tenant isolation applies to workflow reads/writes
