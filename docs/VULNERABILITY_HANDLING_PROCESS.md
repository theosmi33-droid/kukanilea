# VULNERABILITY_HANDLING_PROCESS

Date: 2026-02-21

## Purpose
Define coordinated vulnerability handling across intake, triage, remediation, disclosure, and patch delivery.

## Intake

- Public security contact must exist (`security.txt` and project docs).
- All security reports receive an internal tracking ID.
- Reporter acknowledgements are sent within 3 business days.

## Triage

- Severity classes: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`.
- Initial triage SLA:
  - Critical/High: 1 business day
  - Medium/Low: 5 business days

## Fix SLA Targets

- Critical: mitigation or fix within 72h.
- High: mitigation or fix within 7 days.
- Medium: 30 days.
- Low: next planned release window.

## Disclosure (CVD)

- Prefer coordinated disclosure with reporter.
- Publish advisory text once mitigation is available.
- Include affected versions, fixed versions, workaround, and evidence links.

## Support and Patch Availability

- Maintain clear support horizon per release line.
- Security fixes should be available for supported lines only.
- Unsupported versions must be explicitly marked as such in advisories.

## Required Release Evidence

- Vulnerability register snapshot (open/resolved by severity).
- Patch availability evidence (release notes + fix commit links).
- Advisory references for externally disclosed issues.

## security.txt

- Security contact location:
  - `/Users/gensuminguyen/Tophandwerk/kukanilea-bench/static/.well-known/security.txt`
