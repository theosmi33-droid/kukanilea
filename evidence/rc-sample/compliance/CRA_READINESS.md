# CRA_READINESS

Date: 2026-02-21

## Purpose
Track Cyber Resilience Act readiness items as concrete release gates.

## Timeline Anchors

- CRA entered into force: 2024-12-10.
- Reporting obligations start: 2026-09-11.
- Main obligations apply: 2027-12-11.

## RC/Prod Preparation Tracks

1. Secure development lifecycle evidence.
2. Vulnerability handling process with SLA and disclosure path.
3. Update and patch availability process.
4. Incident reporting and traceability readiness.
5. Supply-chain integrity evidence (SBOM/provenance/attestations roadmap).

## Current Status

- RC: `BLOCKED` for CRA-complete posture.
- Prod: `NO-GO` until vulnerability lifecycle and reporting workflow are operationalized.
